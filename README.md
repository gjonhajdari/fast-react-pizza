# Fast React Pizza Web App

A simple web app that allows users to place new pizza orders to their home. Built to highlight `Redux Toolkit` as well as modern routing with `RouterProvider`.

Project based on [The Ultimate React Course 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.
